## Continuous Feedback Plan

This document outlines how to collect, triage, and act on user feedback after the Demand Planning application has been deployed. It ensures that issues are captured quickly and enhancements are prioritised based on real‑world usage.

### 1. Feedback Channels

Users can provide feedback or raise issues through the following channels:

1. **Slack**: A dedicated Slack channel (e.g. `#demand-planning-feedback`) should be created. All project stakeholders – including end users, developers and product owners – should join. Encourage users to post questions, issues and enhancement ideas directly in this channel.

2. **Email**: An email alias such as `demand-planning-support@yourcompany.com` should be set up to forward messages to the development and product teams. Include this address in the app’s README and user documentation so users know where to send feedback.

3. **GitHub Issues**: For more formal bug reports or feature requests, users can open issues in this repository. The issue template should ask for relevant details such as steps to reproduce a bug or a description of a desired enhancement.

### 2. Feedback Triage Process

1. **Point of Contact (POC)**: Assign a primary point of contact (or rotate the role weekly) to monitor incoming feedback across all channels. The POC acknowledges each new report and logs it in the GitHub issue tracker with appropriate labels (e.g. `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`).

2. **Prioritisation**: Review new issues during weekly team meetings. Prioritise based on severity, user impact, and alignment with the project roadmap. Critical bugs should be addressed immediately; less urgent enhancements can be scheduled for future sprints.

3. **Communication**: Keep reporters informed about the status of their feedback. When an issue is resolved, update or close the GitHub issue and post a short update in the Slack channel or email thread.

### 3. Post‑Deployment Review

Within one to two weeks after launch, schedule a post‑deployment review meeting with key stakeholders (project sponsor, product manager, lead developer, and representative users). During this session:

* Present usage statistics from the live app (e.g. number of users, frequency of uploads, forecasting operations performed).
* Summarise feedback received through Slack, email and GitHub Issues.
* Discuss any pain points or technical issues observed and agree on remediation steps.
* Prioritise new feature requests based on user impact and feasibility.

Document the meeting outcomes, assign tasks for follow‑up, and integrate agreed items into the development backlog.

### 4. Ongoing Updates

The feedback process should continue beyond the initial review. Maintain a regular cadence (e.g. monthly) for reviewing and triaging new feedback. Periodically revisit the roadmap to accommodate emerging needs and technology changes.

By establishing clear channels and a structured process, the team can respond quickly to user needs and continuously improve the Demand Planning application.
