## UI/UX Enhancement Plan

This document outlines the strategy for elevating the Demand Planning application to an enterprise‑level user experience.  It draws on best‑practice guidelines for dashboard design and user‑centred design principles.

### 1. User Research and Personas

1. **Research activities**: Interview construction planners, supply‑chain analysts and consultants to map their workflows, pain points and decision criteria.  Complement qualitative interviews with quantitative data from the existing application (e.g. feature usage and task completion times).
2. **Persona creation**: Synthesize research findings into distinct personas.  Goal‑directed and role‑based personas help the team empathize with user groups and design accordingly【639264368082464†L65-L87】.  At minimum, develop personas for:
   * **Project Manager** – requires a strategic view across multiple projects and needs high‑level KPIs.
   * **Supply‑chain Analyst** – focuses on detailed forecasting and inventory optimisation tasks.
   * **Executive** – needs concise summaries and the ability to drill down into key metrics.

### 2. Interface Design

1. **Intuitive information architecture**: Group related metrics logically and prioritise information based on importance.  The layout should follow a clear logical flow so users can quickly find what they need【825701666629922†L196-L208】.
2. **Brand consistency**: Apply the organisation’s colours, typography and logo consistently throughout the interface to reinforce brand identity【825701666629922†L261-L271】.
3. **Responsive design**: Design for desktops, tablets and phones.  Prioritise critical information on smaller screens and test across devices【825701666629922†L236-L247】.

### 3. User Experience Optimisation

1. **Streamlined workflows**: Guide users through complex processes step‑by‑step (e.g. wizard‑style forms for uploads and forecasting).  Provide sensible defaults and contextual help.
2. **Interactivity**: Offer dynamic filters, drill‑down interactions and tooltips to encourage exploration【825701666629922†L223-L234】.  Allow users to click on data points for more detail.
3. **Robust input validation**: Validate file types and data schemas on the client side and display clear error messages when issues arise.

### 4. Advanced Visualisation Tools

1. **Data visualisation mastery**: Choose appropriate chart types for each metric (lines for trends, bars for categories, scatter plots for relationships) and avoid unnecessary embellishments【825701666629922†L209-L221】.
2. **Real‑time indicators**: Show when data was last refreshed and allow users to toggle between real‑time and historical views【825701666629922†L249-L259】.
3. **Drill‑down and comparisons**: Enable users to compare scenarios (e.g. baseline vs. optimised forecast) and view details for specific data points.

### 5. Feedback and Iterative Design

1. **Integrated feedback loop**: Embed links within the UI that route users to Slack, email, or GitHub Issues for submitting feedback.  Use the feedback triage process outlined in `docs/feedback_plan.md`.
2. **Usability testing**: Conduct remote usability sessions with 5–8 representative users for each design iteration.  Measure completion times, errors and satisfaction to guide improvements.
3. **Iterative sprints**: Schedule regular design sprints to incorporate feedback and analytics.

### 6. Integration and Scalability

1. **Seamless integration**: Align data import/export flows and dashboards with external SCM tools and systems.  Use consistent terminology and icons to reduce cognitive load.
2. **Multi‑tenant support**: If serving multiple clients, provide tenant‑switching controls and isolate data and branding per tenant.

### 7. Prototyping and Wireframing

1. **Low‑fidelity wireframes**: Begin with sketches or wireframes to validate layout and navigation.  Example wireframes are included in the `/wireframes` folder (see repository root or attachments).  Each wireframe shows a consistent header, navigation bar and content area for Home, Upload, Forecast, Inventory and Admin sections.
2. **High‑fidelity prototypes**: Build interactive prototypes (e.g. in Figma) that reflect the final look and feel.  Share these with stakeholders for validation before implementation.

### 8. Documentation and Guidelines

1. **Design system**: Create a style guide specifying typography, colour palettes, spacing, button styles, chart conventions and iconography.  Store these guidelines in the repository for reference.
2. **Developer handoff**: Provide detailed specifications (component dimensions, colour codes, interactions) and annotate prototypes to minimise ambiguity.

By following this plan, the Demand Planning application can be transformed into an enterprise‑grade solution with a user experience on par with leading planning platforms.
